# TRIPLE PENDULUM SIMULATION WITH PYTHON
Demonstration of a multi-body dynamics calculation program of a triple pendulum system. Program written mainly with numpy and matplotlib libraries (with a minor help from pandas to inspect matrices). 
The main program to run is "triplePendulumUTAMA.py". 

No dedicated libraries for multibody-dynamics are used.
